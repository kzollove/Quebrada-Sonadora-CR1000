# Quebrada-Sonadora-CR1000
The source code for the operation of the Campbell Datalogger at Sonadora (Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory)

This is the V15 code (current as of May 15 2020) with the old code commented out

Serves as a reference to programs that were running before V15, specifically with Turner and Campbell sensors instead of YSI Exo2
